[00:13.82] I've got a song that nobody knows
[00:20.84] I put it on when nobody's home
[00:27.13] It sounds like high school, front gate, smoke in my face
[00:30.66] It sounds like dyed, frayed, high-waist, bought at Supré
[00:34.06] It sounds like loving you is easy but they boosted the bass
[00:37.53] It sounds like—
[00:41.12] It sounds like iPod Touch, yellow Pikachu case
[00:44.67] FL Studio free download in my search history
[00:48.14] Hidden underneath my pillow 'cause I should be asleep
[00:51.46] It sounds like—, I'm keepin' it a secret
[00:54.98] It sounds like I've got a song that nobody knows
[00:58.62] And I heard it in a post when I was twelve years old
[01:01.79] I didn't know it would score the 64-bus home
[01:05.54] Turn a Monday to a memory and change my world
[01:08.84] It sounds like iPod Touch, little crack in thе screen
[01:12.55] FL Studio so late, I fell asleep on the kеys
[01:16.08] With it looping through the speakers, bleeding into my dreams
[01:19.35] It sounds like—
[01:22.68] It sounds like—
[01:30.18] 
[02:20.72] I've got a song that nobody knows
[02:23.70] And I heard it in a post when I was twelve years old
[02:27.18] I didn't know it would score the 64-bus home
[02:30.77] Turn a Monday to a memory and change my world
[02:34.15] It sounds like first day, hallway, starting year eight
[02:37.54] It sounds like beach day, heatwave, stoned and afraid
[02:41.07] It sounds like me and my computer hangin' out until late
[02:44.54] It sounds like—
[02:48.06] It sounds like iPod Touch, yellow Pikachu case
[02:51.71] FL Studio free download in my search history
[02:55.19] Hidden underneath my pillow 'cause I should be asleep
[02:58.44] It sounds like—
[03:01.99] It sounds like—
[03:09.49] 
[03:13.66] I'm keepin' it a secret, it sounds like—
